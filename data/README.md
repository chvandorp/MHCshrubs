# DATA

This folder contains information used by MHCshrubs

## HLA serotypes

The file `HLA_serotypes.tsv` contains A mapping from HLA subtypes to serotypes.
It is compiled from tables in:

> [Holdsworth et al.](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-0039.2008.01183.x) (2009) The HLA dictionary 2008: a summary of HLA‐A, ‐B, ‐C, ‐DRB1/3/4/5, and ‐DQB1 alleles and their association with serologically defined HLA‐A, ‐B, ‐C, ‐DR, and ‐DQ antigens. Tissue Antigens, 73: 95-170.

The dictionary is based on the *expert assigned* column.

## MHC pseudo-sequences

The file `MHC_pseudo.dat` contains HLA pseudo-sequences, i.e. the amino acids at
relevant, possibly non-consecutive positions of the HLA protein.
